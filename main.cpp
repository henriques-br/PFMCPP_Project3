Project 3 - Part 1a-e / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
User-Defined Types

Purpose: The entire purpose of Project 3 is to get you 
writing real C++ code that compiles and runs and to reinforce the syntax habits 
that C++ requires.  
What you create in this project will be used as the basis of 
Project 5.

************************
Part1 purpose:  Learn to write User-Defined Types (UDTs)

You are going to write 10 UDTs in Project3.  
Part1 will be broken up into 5 sub-parts, all on the same branch.
    Part 1a (3 steps): you will learn to think about an object in terms of 
    its sub-parts (sub-objects).
    
    Part 1b (3 steps): you will write 4 un-related UDTs in plain English.
    
    Part 1c (5 steps): you will write 1 UDT in plain English that will be 
    made from 5 related sub-objects.
    
    Part 1d (8 steps): you will write plain-English UDTs for the 5 
    sub-objects that form the UDT defined in Part 1c.
    
    Part 1e (19 steps): you will convert those 10 plain-English UDTs into code 
    that compiles and executes.

Part 1a - Step 1: Lesson 
=================
When we are trying to get a computer to perform work for us, we must define attributes and actions that we want done. 
When there is a lot of work to be done, it is easiest to break that job into smaller parts.
A good example of this is a car. 
A car does a lot of work and uses smaller parts that have specific, focused jobs to get all of that work done.  
- we need the engine to provide the power to drive the wheels. 
- We need the brakes to provide resistance to slow the wheels down. 
- We need an electrical system to power the lights. 
- We need the lights to alert the people around us what we plan on doing and to illuminate the path ahead of us.

Remember this concept of breaking work/objects down into smaller parts while you complete the rest of this project.
It is a simple concept but it is the foundation that all software design is built upon.

Part 1b - Step 1: Lesson
=================
Now you have some basic understanding of how to think of an object 
in terms of its sub-objects.

Next you will write 4 un-related UDTs in plain English:
example:  
 
Thing: Car Wash   
    5 properties:
        - number of vacuum cleaners
        - number of eco-friendly cleaning supplies
        - the amount of water used per week.
        - amount of profit made per week
        - number of cars serviced per day
    3 things it can do:
        - wash and wax car
        - charge customer
        - detail the car interior

    Notice that I did not use "has a vacuum cleaner" or "Has 
    eco-friendly cleaning supplies" as one of the properties.
    
    Writing 'has a ___' checks whether or not your object ** has the 
    ability to do something ** or ** has a particular thing **.
    Instead, I wrote "number of vacuum cleaners" and "number of 
    eco-friendly cleaning supplies".  
    
    These are specific objects or amounts. 
    
    In C++ terms this means to I want you to avoid using 'bool' 
    (has a) as a member variable type.
    Instead, prefer the other primitive types.

    In addition to the usual primitives (covered in Project 2), you 
    can use 'std::string' to represent strings of text in this project.

    - Fill in the 4 UDTs below with a random UDT in plain English.
    - These 4 UDTs do not need to be related.
        a) For each plain-English UDT, write out 5 traits or 
        properties and 3 things it can do.
        b) remember: these properties will eventually become
        primitives.
        c) pick properties that can eventually be represented with 
        'int float double bool char std::string'.

Part 1c - Step 1: Lesson
=================
You have just finished practicing writing out a UDT that has 
5 properties and can perform 3 actions.  

Now you will write 1 more UDT in plain English. 

This UDT will be different than the previous 4 you wrote: It will 
use other UDTs to describe its 5 properties, as opposed to using C++ 
primitives to describe the 5 properties.

You will define these 5 other 'property' UDTs in Part 1d.

Example:
    UDT: Cell Phone

    A Cell Phone is built using the following 5 UDTs:
        Display
        Memory
        CPU
        Radio
        Applications

    A Cell Phone has 3 things it can do:
        make a call
        send a text
        run an application.

    Notice that I did not use "has a display" or "Has memory" or 
    "has a cpu" as one of the properties of the CellPhone.
    
    Writing 'has a ___' checks whether or not your object ** has the 
    ability to do something ** or ** has a particular thing **.
    Instead, I wrote "Display" or "CPU".  These are specific 
    objects. 
    
    In C++ terms, this means to I want you to AVOID USING 'bool' 
    (has a) as a member variable type.
    Instead, prefer the other primitive types or custom UDT.

    When you choose your 5 smaller parts, remember that each of 
    these 5 Sub Objects will need to be defined with 5 primitive 
    properties and 3 actions EACH.

Part 1d - Step 1: Lesson
=================
You now know how to define a UDT that is composed of other UDT.
Now you will learn how to break down those sub-object UDTs into 
their 5 properties and 3 actions.

The goal of Part 1d is to get you to think about breaking down an 
object into smaller and smaller objects, until the smallest object 
is made up of only C++ primitives and std::string. 

Revisiting the previous example: Cell Phone

A Cell Phone is made up of the following 5 properties/sub-objects 
and 3 actions:
    Display
    Memory
    CPU
    Radio
    Applications
3 actions:
    make a call
    send a text
    run an application.

These 5 properties can be broken down into their own sub-objects (UDTs). 

If we break down the first property 'Display' into its 5 properties 
we get:
    brightness
    amount of power consumed.
    pixels
    width in cm
    height in cm

the Display's brightness can be represented with a Primitive, 
such as a double. 

The amount of power consumed can also be represented with a 
Primitive, such as a float or integer (i.e. 250mW)

The 'pixels' property must be represented with an array of Pixel 
instances, as the screen has more than 1 row of pixels.
    Arrays have not been discussed and can't be used in this 
    project.
    Instead, we can use an Integer primitive to store the 
    Number of Pixels:

Display:
    Number of Pixels
    Amount of Power consumed (milliwatt-hours)
    Brightness
    width in cm
    height in cm

As you can see, the 'Display' UDT has been broken down to the 
point of being able to describe it with C++ primitives.

4) make the function parameter lists for your UDTs' member functions use some of your User-Defined Types.  
    - You'll write definitions/implementations for these functions in Project3 Part2
    - you'll call each of these functions in Project3 part3
    - You can use the nested classes you just created.  see the example code below
    - You can also declare instances of these nested classes as member variables, but the intended usage must make sense and must compile without errors.  see the note below the example code. 

Remember: in C++ you cannot use something before it is declared. 
The compiler parses the files from top to bottom.
This means you can only use a UDT AFTER you have written the closing curly brace for it };

Keep this in mind when you define the function parameter lists to use some of your User-Defined Types.

    /*
    A Note regarding functions that use UDTs in their parameter list:
    Pay attention to the member functions that take an instance of 'Car'
    Notice that there is a member variable of the same type.

    It makes sense to pass a Car to the function 'washAndWaxCar' because car washes service MANY cars
    However, they only service ONE car at a time.
    the carBeingServiced's value would change every time you wash and wax the car. 

    I see many students who write code emulating this format, but their usage does not make logical sense.  
    Consider the following snippet:

    struct SoccerTeam
    {
        struct Manager
        {
            ...
        };

        // train their skills
        void trainPlayerSkills(Manager managerA);
    
        Manager teamManager;
    };

    It does not make sense to pass in a new Manager whenever you are going to train your team players.
    Soccer teams have ONE manager.

    a much more relevant usage would be adding a member function that hires a new manager:

    struct SoccerTeam
    {
        struct Manager
        {
            ...
        };

        void hireNewManager(Manager newManager);
    
        Manager teamManager;
    };

    We can safely assume that the 'Manager' instance that is being passed to that function will be replacing the current 'teamManager' variable without looking at any other code.
    This is because the function name and function argument clearly indicate what they are/what they do.

    Your function names and parameter names should make LOGICAL SENSE.
    Readers of your code should be able to INTUITIVELY understand what your function implementations will do without actually seeing the implementations.

    Keep this in mind when you define your UDTs in this project part.
